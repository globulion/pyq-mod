pyq-mod
=======

It contains files of [PyQuante package] modified by me with a couple of extensions: 

  * molecular multipole 1-electron integrals
  * overlap and kinetic 1-electron integral derivatives wrt nuclear coordinates
  * more basis sets added, including 6-311++G\*\* Cartesian (6D) basis set for H, N, C, O, F, S and Na elements
  * modification of orbital shell structure for d and f shells
  * extension of PyQuante.Molecule and PyQuante.BasisSet classes
  * hybrid double-molecular 2-electron J and K integrals

Adding/substituting the source code 
and running standard PyQuante installing routines is sufficient to install this modified
version of PyQuante.

## :exclamation: Compatibility

Compatible with Python 3. Compatibility with Python 2 is *not* guaranteed.
